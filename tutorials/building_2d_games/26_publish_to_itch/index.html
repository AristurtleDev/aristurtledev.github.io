<h1 id="understanding-itchio-as-a-distribution-platform">Understanding itch.io as a Distribution Platform</h1>
<p class="text-secondary">Learn how to deploy your MonoGame project to itch.io and configure it for players across different platforms.</p>
<p>After packaging your game for various platforms in <a href="../25_packaging_game/index.html">Chapter 25</a>, the next step is to make it available for other players.  While there are many distribution platforms available (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://publish.unrealengine.com/v3/welcome">Unreal</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en">Good Old Games (GOG)</a>), <a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a> has become a popular choice for indie developers due to its simple publishing processes, developer-friendly revenue model, and strong community focus.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn about itch.io and why it is beneficial for indie game developers.</li>
<li>Create a project page that effectively showcases your game.</li>
<li>Upload and configure platform-specific builds.</li>
<li>Set up proper metadata and screenshots to attract players.</li>
<li>Test your published game to ensure everything works correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-itchio-as-a-distribution-platform">Understanding itch.io as a Distribution Platform</h2>
<p>Itch.io is an open marketplace for independent digital creators with a focus on indie games.  Unlike larger platforms with strict approval processes, itch.io allows any developer to publish their games instantly.  this makes it a good starting point for new developers looking to build an audience.</p>
<p>Key benefits of itch.io for developers include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Simple Publishing Process</strong>: No approval waiting periods or complex requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Pay-What-You-Want Pricing</strong>: Flexibility to set minimum prices, suggested prices, or make your game completely free.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Platform Support</strong>: Easy distribution for Windows, macOS, and Linux builds.</li>
<li><strong>Community Focused</strong>: Built-in tools for building a community around you and your games, including devlogs and comments.</li>
<li><strong>Developer-Friendly Revenue Split</strong>: The platform lets developers choose their revenue share (the default 90% to developers, 10% to itch.io).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="setting-up-an-itchio-account">Setting Up an itch.io Account</h2>
<p>Before you can publish your game, you need to create an itch.io account and setup your developer profile.  To do this</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Navigate to <a href="https://itch.io">itch.io</a> and click &quot;Register&quot; in the top-right corner.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fill in the registration form with your desired username, password, and email address.</p>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>Your itch.io username will appear in the URL of your games (e.g. <code>https://yourusername.itch.io/dungeon-slime</code>).  Choose a username that represents you or your studio professionally and is easy to remember.</p>
<p>The username can be changed later in your account settings if needed.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>After registering, you will automatically be logged in, however for some additional configurations that need to be made, you must validate your email address.  Check the email address you entered when you registered above for a new email from itch.io to validate the email address.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After validating your email address, go to your account settings by clicking your username in the top-right corner, and then choosing &quot;Settings&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>The settings page opens with your developer profile configuration.  Complete your developer profile with:</p>
<ul>
<li>A profile picture.</li>
<li>Links to your social media platforms or portfolio.</li>
<li>A short biography for your profile page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Next, click &quot;Two factor auth&quot; under the &quot;Basics&quot; section on the left to go through the process of configuring two factor authentication for your account.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you plan to sell your game, you will need to configure your publisher information.  To do this, click the &quot;Get Started&quot; section under &quot;Publisher&quot; on the left and follow the steps presented to configure your account to accept payments.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="creating-a-project-page-for-dungeon-slime">Creating a Project Page for Dungeon Slime</h2>
<p>Once your account is setup, you can created a dedicated page for the game. This page will host all the information, screenshots, and download files.  In this section, we begin by setting the initial information to create a project page.  Complete the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the &quot;Dashboard&quot; navigation link at the top of the itch.io page.</li>
<li>From the dashboard, select &quot;Create new project&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will open the &quot;Create a new project&quot; page which presents you with a form to complete to detail information about the ame, upload the game files, and screenshots.</p>
<h3 id="basic-project-information">Basic Project Information</h3>
<p>First, we will fill in the basic project information on the form. Complete the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Title</strong>: The title of the game is how it will be displayed and shown on itch.io.  For this project, enter &quot;Dungeon Slime&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Project URL</strong>: Once you enter a title, a project URl will be automatically generated based on the title entered.  Since we entered &quot;Dungeon Slime&quot; as the title, the project URl that is automatically generated is <code>https://yourusername.itch.io/dungeon-slime</code>.  For this project we will leave it as is, however it can be customized if you wish to do so.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Short Description or tagline</strong>: Here you can enter a short description that is shown in embedded link previews for your game when you or others share it on different social media platforms.  For this project, enter the following:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-text">A snake-like game where you control a growing slime creature that eats bats to grow larger.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Kind of Project</strong>: Here you can choose the kind of project being uploaded.  Since MonOgame is distrusted by packaging the game and giving players the archived bundle, it is a &quot;Downloadable&quot; kind, so choose this.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Release Status</strong>: Here you can choose the status of the release.  If the project is completed and ready for others to download and play, you can choose &quot;Released&quot;; otherwise, there are other options such as &quot;In development&quot;, &quot;On hold&quot;, &quot;Cancelled&quot;, and &quot;Prototype&quot;.  For this project, choose &quot;Released&quot;.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="pricing">Pricing</h3>
<p>Itch.io offers three pricing models for your project:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>$0 or donate</strong>: With this pricing model, the game can be downloaded for free, but users are given a prompt to ask if they would like to donate an amount.  A suggested minimum donation amount can be configured for this</li>
<li><strong>Paid</strong>: With this pricing model, users must pay a minimum price to download the game.  The price that you set is just the minimum price, users can opt to pay more if they wish to.</li>
<li><strong>No Payment</strong>: With this pricing model, the game is completely free and users will not be prompted for a donation.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can choose whichever option you feel comfortable with.  For the upload for this tutorial, I have chosen the <strong>$0 or donate</strong> option.</p>

<h3 id="upload-game-builds">Upload Game Builds</h3>
<p>Next on the form is the uploads for the game builds.  Here,we will add the platform-specific builds created in <a href="../25_packaging_game/index.html">Chapter 25</a>.  Itch.io supports multiple file uploads for different platforms, allowing you to provide the appropriate version for each player's operating system.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Before uploading, ensure the builds are properly packaged into either ZIP (Windows) or tar.gz (macOS/Linux) archives as discussed in <a href="../25_packaging_game/index.html">Chapter 25</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>To upload, for each build you created:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the &quot;Upload files&quot; button.</li>
<li>In the file select dialog, choose the archive for the platform build you are uploading.</li>
<li>Once the upload is completed, set the type of upload as &quot;Executable&quot;, then check the box for the operating system that build is for.</li>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>When writing a description for your game, you try to write a compelling project description:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with a concise summary of the game's concepts.</li>
<li>List key features and gameplay mechanics.</li>
<li>Mention third party tool and technologies used in developing the game (e.g. MonoGame 😉).</li>
<li>Include credits for any team members, assets or tools uses that require attribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the Dungeon Slime project, here is an example description you can enter:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-text">Dungeon Slime is a snake-like game where you control a growing slime creature navigating through a dungeon room environment.  Eat bats to grow longer, but be careful not to collide with walls or your own body!

Features:

- Classic snake-like gameplay with a dungeon theme.
- Animated pixel art visuals.
- Responsive controls with keyboard or gamepad support.
- Progressive difficulty as your slime grows longer.

Developed with C# and MonoGame as part of the Building 2D Games With MonoGame tutorial series.
